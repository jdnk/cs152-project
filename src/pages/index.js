                I would like to use reinforcement learning to train a model to play No-Limit Texas Hold â€˜Em. Ideally, I would like to have a program capable of analyzing a given board and predicting the ideal (or close to ideal) move to beat players in online poker. The program would give probability ranges for ideal moves (i.e. dealt K-A suited pre-flop, the program would suggest with a certain percentage to raise by x amount). The program would also ideally learn more complex strategy, such as c-betting, bluffing, playing ranges, etc. I would like to have the program be able to play at a table with any amount of players, but I am not sure how complicated/feasible that would be.
